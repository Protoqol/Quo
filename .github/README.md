# Quo

> Quo is currently in beta, releases are only available as zip unless you built Quo yourself.

[Quo is a free, open-source, client-side debugger and can be found here](https://github.com/Protoqol/Quo).

Quo is a debugging companion to help you debug dumped variables, the dumped variables will appear in this Quo client
instead of the
traditional way which is often tedious.
